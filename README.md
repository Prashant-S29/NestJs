# NestJS Enterprise Backend Architecture Repository

This repository is dedicated to mastering NestJS by building an **enterprise-grade backend**. It covers a progression from basics to advanced design patterns and best practices to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable backend.

---

## 🌟 **Goals**
- Master NestJS fundamentals.
- Implement enterprise-grade features and architecture.
- Learn advanced design patterns for scalable applications.

---

## 📚 **Modules Covered**

### **1. NestJS Basics**
This module introduces the foundational concepts of NestJS, including its powerful decorators, middleware, and lifecycle hooks.

#### 🚀 **Features:**
- **Global Exception Filters**: Centralized error handling for cleaner code.
- **Pipes and Validators**: Input validation with \`class-validator\`.
- **Custom Logger**: Implemented for application-wide structured logging.
- **Database Fetching**: Setting up and querying databases seamlessly.
- **API Rate Limitation**: Protect APIs from abuse with rate-limiting strategies.

---

### **2. NestJS Best Practices**
This module covers intermediate concepts and best practices to improve the quality and maintainability of your NestJS projects.

#### 🚀 **Features:**
- **Custom CORS Configuration**: Fine-tuned CORS setup for enhanced security.
- **Global Validation Pipe**: Automatic input validation at the application level.
- **Winston Logger**: Advanced logging with structured log formats.
- **Advanced DTO Patterns**: Improved consistency and scalability in data transfer objects.
- **Global Middleware Logger**: A middleware for logging incoming requests globally.
- **Slightly Advanced Design Patterns**: Practical examples of scalable architecture patterns.

---

## 🛠️ **Future Features**
This repository aims to include additional features that demonstrate mastery of NestJS and advanced backend design:

- Advanced Caching Strategies
- Queue-based Background Jobs
- Event-driven Architecture
- Microservices Support
- Real-time WebSocket Integration
- API Gateway and Service Orchestration

## 🛡️ **Best Practices Checklist**
1. ✅ Use **dependency injection** for all services.
2. ✅ Implement **global exception filters**.
3. ✅ Adopt **centralized validation** via pipes.
4. ✅ Integrate **advanced logging mechanisms**.
5. ✅ Follow **strict TypeScript rules** for type safety.
6. ✅ Implement **scalable database patterns**.
7. ✅ Use **versioned APIs** for backward compatibility.
